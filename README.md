# Get Shit Done

This small script is inspired by:

[`https://github.com/leftnode/get-shit-done.git`](https://github.com/leftnode/get-shit-done.git) by [leftnode](https://github.com/leftnode/).

Only it is written in `zsh` and should work also on Mac. Yeah, PHP sucks for this kind of work.

Good Work!
